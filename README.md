## Code of Conduct

This repo and the web site it generates are governed by the [conda organization code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Implementation details

It is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. The
contents are structured like this:

- `.github/`: Workflows for deployment.
- `blog/`: Blog posts. Can use `.md` (Markdown), `.mdx` (Markdown with react) or `.js` extensions.
  Complex posts can use its own directory.
- `docs/`: Documentation with navigation and sidebars.
- `src/`: Resources (React components, custom CSS) and logic for standalone pages
  - `src/pages`: Standalone pages. This directory contains the homepage (`index.js`) and other simpler pages (`community.md`).
- `static/`: Static resources like images and icons.
- `babel.config.js`: Configuration to install `docusaurus`.
- `docusaurus.config.js`: Configuration for `docusaurus`. Includes variables like title and description, navigation menu items, etc.
- `package.json`: More configuration to install `docusaurus`.
- `sidebars.js`: Support for sidebars. We use in automatic mode now.
