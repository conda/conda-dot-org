# Meeting minutes

We hold biweekly meetings every second Wednesday from 17:00-18:00 (UTC). Feel free to stop by!
Up-to-date invites are always available in the [calendar](/community/calendar).

We encourage contributors to join the meetings and learn more about and from the community.

## Setup

The minutes are recorded in the [`conda-incubator/governance`][governance-repo] repository.

We use a Github Actions [workflow][gha-workflow] to create an automated PR with the meeting notes
template for each session, which is automatically published to our [HackMD team][hackmd-team]
account. During the meeting, attendees will edit the HackMD document. After the meeting, the
document is saved and the PR is synced with the changes by adding the `sync-hackmd-notes` label.
Once satisfied, the PR is merged and the website will be updated with the new meeting notes.
