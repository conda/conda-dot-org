  The latest release of conda introduces two new plugin hooks: pre and post command. These hooks allow plugin
  authors to execute code before and after any conda command. Learn more about how and why you would use
  these in this post.

With the latest conda release (`23.7.2` at the time this post was written), the ability to define
two new plugin hooks was introduced: "pre command" and "post command". These two new plugin hooks give
plugin authors the ability to execute code before and after conda commands are run. In this blog post,
we provide more details on how and why you may use these to extend the default behavior of conda.

To explain how these plugin hooks can be used, we will cover two examples.

## Conda protect and the "pre command" hook

The project linked to above is called [`conda-protect`][conda-protect], and it extends conda by adding functionality
to "protect" a conda environment from being changed. Sometimes users may want to do this to protect themselves
from [unintentionally modifying their base environments][conda-issue].

Using the "pre command" plugin hook, we can first specify which commands we want to be protected and then
run a function that gets called before the command gets executed. By doing this, we can figure out whether
the environment is protected or not and exit early if so. Below is how such a plugin hook would be defined:

```python
from conda import plugins

def conda_protect_pre_commands_action(command: str) -> None:
    """Checks to see if the current environment is protected"""
    environment = get_current_environment()

    if is_guarded(environment):
        raise CondaError(
            f"Current environment is protect. Run `conda guard {environment}` to "
            "remove protection."
        )

@plugins.hookimpl
def conda_pre_commands():
    yield plugins.CondaPreCommand(
        name=f"conda_protect_pre_command",
        action=conda_protect_pre_commands_action,
        run_for={"install", "remove", "update", "env_update", "env_remove"},
    )
```

In the example above, we first register our plugin hook by defining a function called
`conda_pre_commands` and then decorating it with the `hookimpl` function provided by conda.
Inside the hook function itself we return a `CondaPreCommand` object, which defines the following:

- **name**: how this plugin hook will be internally reference by conda
- **action**: a callable object that will be invoked before the commands defined in `run_for` are
  executed
- **run_for**: a `set` of commands that this plugin hook should be used with

Going back to our example, if we wanted to create a plugin that would prevent us from mistakenly
modifying protected environments, it would make sense to define `run_for` as all the conda commands
that could potentially modify an environment (e.g. `install`, `remove`, etc.).

To actually prevent us from modifying our protected environments, the `action` function
checks if the current environment is protected and then throws a `CondaError` if it is to make
sure that the program exits early with a meaningful error message for the user.

## Simple command counter with the "post command" hook

The "post command" hook functions in exactly the same way as the "pre command" except that it gets
called once a conda command has successfully finished running. It is important to note that if
the command exits early for any reason, this plugin hook will not be invoked.

To illustrate how this is used, we will create a simple plugin that counts how many times we have
run a particular conda command. We can use this later to analyze our usage of conda ü§ì üìä

Here is a snippet of how that plugin might look:

```python
from conda.cli.conda_argparse import BUILTIN_COMMANDS
from conda import plugins

ENV_COMMANDS = {
    "env_config", "env_create",
    "env_export", "env_list",
    "env_remove", "env_update"
}

def conda_stats_post_commands_action(command: str):
    """Counts how many times we have run a particular conda command"""
    database = get_database()
    database.add_command(command)

@plugins.hookimpl
def conda_post_commands():
    yield plugins.CondaPostCommand(
        name=f"conda_stats_post_command",
        action=conda_stats_post_commands_action,
        run_for=BUILTIN_COMMANDS.union(ENV_COMMANDS),
    )
```

The example above registers our "post command" hook by defining a function called
`conda_post_commands`. Very similarly to the "pre command" hook, this returns a
`CondaPostCommand` object which defines `name`, `action` and `run_for`. The `action`
function counts the usage of the command each time it is run and the `run_for` property
is configured to run for every built-in conda command, including the `conda env *`
commands.

:::note

The implementation of the database has been purposely left out of the example as it
falls out of scope of this blog post (implement it yourself for fun! üòÖ).

[conda-protect][conda-protect] project. This project can also be used as a starting template
for your plugins.
