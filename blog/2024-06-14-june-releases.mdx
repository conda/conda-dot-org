The June 2024 releases included updates to conda-index, conda-package-streaming and conda-package-handling! 🎉 All of these new releases have been released to both `main` and `conda-forge`.

## Changes in conda-index [0.5.0](https://github.com/conda/conda-index/releases/tag/0.5.0)

To update conda-index to the latest version, run:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-index=0.5.0
```

### ✨ What's New? ✨

- Add experimental `python -m conda_index.json2jlap` script to run after indexing, to create `repodata.jlap` patch sets for incremental repodata downloads.
- Add `--current-repodata/--no-current-repodata` flags to control whether
  `current_repodata.json` is generated.
- Add support for CEP-15 `base_url` to host packages separate from repodata.
- Support fsspec (in the API only) to index any fsspec-supported remote
  filesystem. Also enables the input packages folder to be separate from the
  cache and output folders.

### 🔧 What Got Fixed? 🔧

- Move `run_exports.json` query into cache, instead of directly using SQL in
  `ChannelIndex`.
- Create parents when creating `<subdir>/.cache`.

### ⚙️ Other Updates ⚙️

- Approach 100% code coverage in test suite; reformat with ruff.
- Update CI configuration to test on more platforms.
- Drop support for Python 3.7; support Python 3.8+ only.

## Changes in conda-package-handling [2.3.0](https://github.com/conda/conda-package-handling/releases/tag/2.3.0)

To update conda-package-handling to the latest version, run:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-package-handling=2.3.0
```

<!-- truncate -->

### ✨ What's New? ✨

- Add `cph list` to report artifact contents without prior extraction.
- Added formal support for Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

### 🔧 What Got Fixed? 🔧

- Delay `os.getcwd()` call to body of `CondaFormat_v2.create()` when `out_folder` is not passed.

### 🌅 Deprecations 🌅

- Removed formal support for Python 3.7.

### ⚙️ Other Updates ⚙️

- Remove MANIFEST.in, used for Python sdists, which referenced non-existent files. Source distributions appear correct without MANIFEST.in.
- Add explicit `zstandard` dependency.

## Changes in conda-package-streaming [0.10.0](https://github.com/conda/conda-package-streaming/releases/tag/v0.10.0)

To update conda-package-streaming to the latest version, run:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-package-streaming=0.10.0
```

<!-- truncate -->

### ✨ What's New? ✨

- Use zip64 extensions when converting .tar.bz2 to .conda, if uncompressed size is close to the 2GB ZIP64_LIMIT.
