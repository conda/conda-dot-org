## Changes in conda [25.9.0](https://github.com/conda/conda/releases/tag/25.9.0)

:::warning Special Announcement

Following feedback from conda users last year about the pre-configuration of the conda code base to favor channels from Anaconda Inc, we've [finished removing](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/14178) hardcoding Anaconda's channels as the default set of channels in the conda source code.

It is now up to providers of the conda distributions, such as [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or Anaconda (including miniconda), to pre-configure their preferred channels, e.g. by running the necessary `conda config --set channels` command.

:::

To update `conda` to the latest version, run:

```bash
conda install -n base conda=25.9.0
```

**Notable Changes:**

- Added two new health checks to `conda doctor`:
    - Check for ill-formed pinned file.
    - Check whether file locking is supported.
- Prevent renaming an environment currently listed as the `default_activation_env`.
- Added a new environment specifier, `cep-24`. This is a stricter version of the `environment.yml` format that enforces [specific requirements](/learn/ceps/cep-0024) and can be used when creating an environment from a file, e.g., `conda env create --file FILE --environment-specifier cep-24`.
- Update environment model to support multiple platforms. This allows `conda export --format FORMAT` to support exporting multiple platforms at once.
- Annotate frozen environments in `conda env list`.
- Various deprecations.

## Changes in conda-build [25.9.0](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/releases/tag/25.9.0)

To update `conda-build` to the latest version, run:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-build=25.9.0
```

**Notable Changes:**

No major changes to report. We just removed some deprecated code according to our deprecation schedule and made corrections to documentation.
