**Notable Changes:**
- Add `environment_specifiers` plugin hooks to allow plugin authors to read different file formats and sources.

- Add a `--fields` flag to conda list that allows to customize the content of the `human` output format (i.e. the default output format).
- Add a plugin hook for adding actions during the transaction process.
