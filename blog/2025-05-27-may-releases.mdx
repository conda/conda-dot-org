## Changes in conda [25.5.0](https://github.com/conda/conda/releases/tag/25.5.0)

To update `conda` to the latest version, run:

```bash
conda install -n base conda=25.5.0
```

**Notable Changes:**
- Add `environment_specifiers` plugin hooks to allow plugin authors to read different file formats and sources.
- Add a plugin hook for `PrefixData` loaders and use it to wrap the existing PyPI interoperability features. These are now present in `conda.plugins.prefix_data_loaders.pypi`.
- Add a `--fields` flag to conda list that allows to customize the content of the `human` output format (i.e. the default output format).
- Add a plugin hook for adding actions during the transaction process.
- Add a `default_activation_env` config option to simplify environment activation after initialization and when running `conda activate` without parameter.
- Add support for conda plugin settings to the `conda config` command.
