Conda is moving our social media presence from Twitter/X to Mastodon and LinkedIn at the start of 2024. It's past time to move into spaces that are welcoming and more in line with our community values.

Going forward, you can find us at

- **[@conda@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@conda) on Mastodon**
- **[Conda Community](https://linkedin.com/company/condacommunity) on LinkedIn**

If you are on either platform then please follow and link to those accounts, or, just use the `#conda` hashtag.

We won't close the Twitter account. We will update it to say it is no longer active, and point users to the conda communities on Mastodon and LinkedIn. If you are active on Twitter, we encourage you to also use the `#conda` hashtag.

We hope to see you on Mastodon and LinkedIn in 2024!

PS: conda-forge is discussing making the same move.
