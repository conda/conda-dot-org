### **With this 23.10.0 release we are changing the default solver of conda to [`conda-libmamba-solver`](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/)!** ðŸ¥³ ðŸš€

`libmamba` builds on [libsolv](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv), a much faster solver from openSUSE. The previous "classic" solver is based on [pycosat](https://github.com/conda/pycosat)/[Picosat](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/) and will remain part of conda for the foreseeable future. A [fallback is possible and available](/blog/2023-11-06-conda-23-10-0-release#what-can-i-do-if-this-update-doesnt-work-for-me).

### Why are we switching the solver?

In short: to make conda faster and more accurate.

A "solver" is a core component of many package managers; it calculates which dependencies (and which version of those dependencies) to install when a user requests to install a package from a package repository. To address growth-related challenges within the conda ecosystem, the conda maintainers, alongside partners [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com/) and [QuantStack](https://quantstack.net/), introduced a new conda dependency solver based on the [Mamba project](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) in December 2022.

Since July 2023, the [`conda-libmamba-solver`](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver) plugin has been included in all major conda ecosystem installers ([miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/), [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/index.html), [mambaforge](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/) and [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download)), but was disabled by default. As soon as these installers are updated to contain conda 23.10.0 or later, they will automatically default to using the conda-libmamba-solver plugin.

### What changes will I notice?

- First, complex solves will run noticeably faster. [Benchmarking](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community) predicts a 50 to 80% improvement in run times.
- Second, you will notice improved error messages when conda encounters problems. [libmamba's error messages give you more insight into what is triggering the problem](https://medium.com/@AntoineProuvost/managing-conflicts-with-mamba-6a5fa10ed6a).
- Third, `conda-libmamba-solver` outputs more details about the channels in use and target platform at the beginning of the process. Mind these differences if you are parsing `stdout` (although we definitely recommend enabling the `--json` mode for programmatic usage!).

### What can I do if this update doesn't work for me?

If the new solver is not working as you expect:

- Check if the behavior you are observing is a [known issue](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver/issues/283) or a [deliberate change](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/libmamba-vs-classic/#intentional-deviations-from-classic).
- If that's not the case, please consider submitting a bug report or feature request in the [conda-libmamba-solver repository](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver/issues/new/choose).
- If necessary, you can go back to using the `classic` solver without modifying your conda installation:
  - When possible, pass the command line option `--solver=classic` to your `conda` calls.
  - Otherwise (e.g. for `conda build ...` or `constructor ...`), set the environment variable `CONDA_SOLVER=classic`.
  - For permanent changes, use the conda configuration system: `conda config --set solver classic`.

### Where can I learn more about conda-libmamba-solver?

The documentation of the `conda-libmamba-solver` plugin can be found on [conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/).

For more information about the `conda-libmamba-solver` rollout plan, please also see our [blog post from earlier this year](https://conda.org/blog/2023-07-05-conda-libmamba-solver-rollout).

### Other parts of conda are faster too

The libmamba integration is part of a larger effort to improve the run time of conda. See also:

- [How we reduced conda's index fetch bandwidth by 99%](https://conda.org/blog/2023-05-05-how-we-reduced-the-conda-index-fetch-bandwidth/).
- [Conda now downloads and extracts packages in parallel](https://conda.org/blog/2022-12-06-conda-release-22-11-1), which greatly speeds up package downloads when latency is high.
- conda-package-handling, a library and command line utility used by `conda` and `conda-build` to handle `.conda` and `.tar.bz2`, [is now twice as fast as it was before](https://conda.github.io/conda-package-handling/#a-new-major-version).
