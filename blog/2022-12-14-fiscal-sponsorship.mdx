**The [conda Organization](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/) is delighted to announce that we are now [fiscally sponsored by NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/project/conda).** This will enable conda to apply for grants, accept and distribute funds, manage trademarks and own web domains with a distinct legal standing.

This milestone demonstrates how far the organization has come in creating an effective open source community with capable governance processes on par with other established projects. With this sponsorship comes the promise of further development - such as transitioning into full openness within GitHub â€“ so stay tuned!
