Conda has long been the driver of data science workflows because of its unique ability to manage the complexities around Python packaging's diverse dependency requirements. It's precisely because of this that conda is also able to handle managing much more than just Python dependencies.

In the first part of a multi-part blog post series, we'll show the strengths of conda's flexibility and provide a tutorial on how you can install [PostgreSQL][postgresql-org] for local development environments.

## Prerequisites

Throughout this tutorial, we show you how to install and run PostgreSQL from [conda-forge][conda-forge] using either [conda][conda-docs] or [pixi][pixi]. Please refer to those project's documentation for information on how to install them.

## Setting up your environment

To start, we'll create a new environment with the `postgresql` package.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="conda" label="conda" default>

    To create a new conda environment with PostgreSQL GIS extensions, run the following command:

    ```bash
    conda create \
      --name postgresql \
      --channel conda-forge \
      postgresql
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pixi" label="pixi">
    To create a new pixi project with PostgreSQL and GIS extensions, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Create your project directory first
    mkdir postgresql && cd postgresql

    # Initialize your pixi environment and add dependencies
    pixi init && pixi add postgresql
    ```

    :::tip

    You can also use `pixi global` to create a single installation of PostgreSQL that's available only to your user account:

    ```
    pixi global install postgresql
    ```
    :::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Running PostgreSQL

Now that we have our environment setup and packages installed, we can initialize our database and get it running. The `postgresql` package exposes the following commands that we'll use to do that:

- `initdb`
- `createuser`
- `createdb`
- `pg_ctl`

### Creating a data directory

The first thing we need to is create the directory we'll use to store our data. For my example I'm going to create a "postgresql" directory in my home directory, but this could be anywhere you'd like:

```bash
mkdir ~/postgresql
initdb -D ~/postgresql
```

### Starting the server

Now that we have a location set for storing our data, we can launch the `postgresql` process by running the following command:

```bash
pg_ctl -D ~/postgresql -l ~/postgresql/logfile start
```

With `-D`, we pass it the location of our data directory and the `-l` option tells postgresql where to write its logs too.

### Creating a user and a database

The next two commands will create a user account and database we can use for our application:

```bash
createuser user && createdb --owner user user
```

After this, your new database should be ready to accept connections. You can test this by running the following `psql` command:

```bash
psql -U user
```

:::warning

At this point, the database accepts connections from localhost without passwords (e.g. "trust"). This is only advisable if you are the only person using your computer. Read further to learn how to adjust this.

:::

### Editing the configuration

To make changes to how the server is configured, you can edit the default configuration that was created with the `initdb` command. The two most important files for postgresql's configuration are:

- `pg_hba.conf`: controls authentication
- `postgresql.conf`: all other configuration settings

For example, if you wanted to change the default authentication behavior of your postgresql server, you could edit the lines at the bottom of the `pg_hba.conf` to use `password` instead of `trust`:

```conf

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     password
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            password
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 password
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
local   replication     all                                     password
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            password
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 password
```

Afterwards, you would need to restart the server with the following command:

```bash
pg_ctl -D ~/postgresql -l ~/postgresql/logfile restart
```

## Final thoughts

We hope this gave you a good orientation on using PostgreSQL via conda! Installing PostgreSQL in this way can sometimes be a lighter-weight alternative than using container based solutions like Docker. Because you can install PostgreSQL this way, it also opens up possibilities for bundling applications that use PostgreSQL with conda.
