[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) is a powerful package and environment manager for Python that can be used to create and manage multiple Python environments on your machine. 
This is useful when you need to work on different projects that require different versions of Python or different sets of packages. 
In this blog post, we'll show you how to use conda to manage multiple Python environments.

## Installation

The installation instructions are already listed on our [conda.io documentation page](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#id2).
Choose from the type of Operating System you are currently on Windows ,macOS or Linux. 

To make sure that you have conda installed on your system. Run the following command on your terminal.


```bash
conda list
```

You should see all the packages installed in the current environment, If the installtion was done correctly!

## Creating a virtual environment

Once you have conda installed, you can create a new environment by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.8
```

This command creates a new environment called **myenv** with **Python 3.8** installed. You can replace **myenv** with any name you like, 
and you can choose a different version of Python if you prefer.

## Activating an environment

To activate the **myenv** environment, run the following command:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

This command activates the **myenv** environment and sets it as the default environment for your terminal session. 
Any packages you install or commands you run will use the Python version and packages in the **myenv** environment.

<!-- truncate -->

You can confirm that you're in the **myenv** environment by running the following command:

```bash
which python
```

This command should return the path to the Python executable in the **myenv**  environment.


## Installing packages

To install packages in the myenv environment, you can use the **conda install** command. 
For example, to install NumPy and Pandas, you can run the following command:

```bash
conda install numpy pandas
```

This command installs the latest version of NumPy and Pandas in the myenv environment.

<!-- truncate -->

You can also specify a specific version of a package by adding the version number after the package name. For example, to install NumPy version 1.18, you can run the following command:



```bash
conda install numpy=1.18
```


## Listing environments

To list all of the environments on your machine, you can run the following command:

```bash
conda info --envs
```

This command lists all of the environments that you have created, including the default **base** environment.

## Deactivating an environment

To deactivate the myenv environment and return to the base environment, run the following command:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

## Removing an environment


To remove the **myenv** environment, run the following command:

This command removes the **myenv** environment and all of the packages installed in it.


## Summary

In this blog, we discussed how conda could assist developers in managing multiple Python environments
in numerous projects hassle free. You can avoid conflicts between different versions of Python and different sets of packages. With the commands we've covered in this blog post, 
you should be able to create, activate, and manage multiple Python environments using conda.
