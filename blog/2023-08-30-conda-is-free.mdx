Hi All,

A new blog post, titled "[**Is `conda` Free?**](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/is-conda-free)", answers your questions about:

1. what is free to use in the conda ecosystem (most everything),
2. what parts of that ecosystem may not be free, and
3. under what clearly defined circumstances those *maybe-not-free* parts can still be free after all.

There has been confusion around this since Anaconda introduced its [Terms of Service](https://legal.anaconda.com/policies/en/?name=terms-of-service) in 2020. I hope the [post](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/is-conda-free) banishes that confusion (forevermore!). The post is framed as a discussion, introducing why there might be confusion about this topic, and then diving into the details.

Happy reading, and using the conda ecosystem too!<br />

PS: If reading the discussion doesn't grab you then [go straight the summary](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/is-conda-free#summarize) and just pretend you read the whole thing.

PPS: Spoiler alert! ... *Yes.*
