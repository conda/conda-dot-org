[Conda Announce](https://lists.conda.org/wws/info/announce) is a new mailing list for announcements and news relevant to the conda ecosystem and community.

If you want to stay informed about software releases, new features, upcoming events, and other community news then this is the list for you.

The mailing list is moderated and low-volume: Most news will go out in monthly summary posts. (Our goal is to keep the list volume low enough, and the content relevant enough, that you donâ€™t feel a need to filter it out of your inbox.)

We hope to see you online!
