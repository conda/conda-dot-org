## Changes in conda [25.3.0](https://github.com/conda/conda/releases/tag/25.3.0)/[25.3.1](https://github.com/conda/conda/releases/tag/25.3.1)

To update `conda` to the latest version, run:

```bash
conda install -n base conda=25.3.1
```

**Notable Changes:**
- Add support for Python 3.13.
- Refactor CMD's activation process to use a static shell script instead of a dynamic temporary script. This resolves an issue where using `conda activate` would fail when Windows AppLocker script execution restrictions were enabled.
- `conda 25.3.0` is a deprecation release (see [CEP-9](https://github.com/conda/ceps/blob/main/cep-0009.md) for details) so watch out for deprecated features (previously marked as pending deprecation), many of these deprecated features will be removed in `conda 25.9.0`.
