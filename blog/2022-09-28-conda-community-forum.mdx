We are pleased to announce the launch of the [**conda Community Forum**](https://conda.discourse.group/categories), a gathering place for questions, answers, and discussion about the conda ecosystem.

We hope the forum will be a key component of that ecosystem, and will become the goto place for people with questions about conda & friends.

<!-- truncate -->

The forum is organized in several broad [categories](https://conda.discourse.group/categories), each with a different focus:

- [**Users**](https://conda.discourse.group/c/use/7)
  - Questions, answers and discussion about how to use the conda ecosystem to manage software packages, and run time environments.
- [**Package Builders**](https://conda.discourse.group/c/pkg-building/15)
  - How to make software packages available in the conda ecosystem.
- [**Contributors**](https://conda.discourse.group/c/contrib/12)
  - Conda ecosystem development and infrastructure.
- [**News**](https://conda.discourse.group/c/news/6)
  - Items of interest to the conda community.
- [**Site**](https://conda.discourse.group/c/site/2)
  - Rules, policies, questions, answers, and discussion about this site.

Thanks to everyone who helped get this site ready. And thanks in advance to the entire community for posting your questions, answers, discussions and up-votes here. We look forward to having this site become a vital knowledge base for the community.

Got a question? The Conda Community Forum is the right spot.
