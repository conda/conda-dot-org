We are pleased to announce the launch of the [**conda Community Forum**](https://conda.discourse.group/categories), a gathering place for questions, answers, and discussion about the conda ecosystem.

We hope the forum will be a key component of that ecosystem, and will become the goto place for people with questions about conda & friends.
