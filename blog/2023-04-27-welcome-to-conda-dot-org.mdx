Welcome to [conda.org](https://conda.org)! This website was created by and for the [conda community](/community)
and aims to support the greater conda ecosystem. As a site visitor, these are just some of the things
you can expect to find here going forward:

- **News and updates** for many projects within the conda ecosystem; from organizations such as [conda][conda-github],
  [mamba][mamba-github], and [conda-forge][conda-forge-github]
- Information on **how to get involved** with our projects (check out the [Community](/community) page)
- **Emerging trends and technologies** within the ecosystem; this site will be a platform to promote
  cutting edge work going on in the community
- Plus more!

## Going forward

Below are just a couple of the feature requests that we plan on implementing in the coming months:

- An embedded community calendar so we can advertise all conda community events in a single place
- Blog posts on various aspects of managing [conda][conda-project-github], as well as tutorial articles

Check out even more of our open and planned issues [here][conda-dot-org-github-issues].

## We need you ‚òùÔ∏è

Are you involved in a project within the conda ecosystem and want to share your experiences? Does writing a blog
post about it sound fun? If so, we encourage you to reach out to us via our [GitHub project][conda-dot-org-github],
(go ahead and create an issue), or contact us directly via our [Matrix chat][conda-dot-org-matrix]. We are currently looking to
fill our blog with a diverse set of entries from the entire conda community.

If you have ideas about new features we could add to this website or want to become a volunteer, please reach out
to us.
