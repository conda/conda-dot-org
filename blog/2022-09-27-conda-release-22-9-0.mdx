# `conda` 22.9.0 Released

## Special announcement

If you have been following the conda project previously, you will notice a change in our version number for this release. We have officially switched to the [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning system as agreed upon in [CEP 8](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/blob/main/cep-8.md) (Conda Enhancement Proposal).

Please read that CEP for more information, but here is a quick synopsis. We hope that this versioning system and our release schedule will help make our releases more predictable and transparent to the community going forward. We are now committed to making at least one release every two months, but keep in mind that we can (and most likely will) be making minor version releases within this window.
