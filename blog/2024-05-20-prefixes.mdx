In the realm of package management and environment configuration, `conda` has
emerged as a versatile tool empowering developers with environment management. A
pivotal aspect of `conda`'s architecture lies in its prefix system, which
underwent a significant evolution over its previous versions, transforming `conda` from a
simple package manager into a sprawling environment manager. In this technical
discourse, we delve into the intricacies of `conda`'s prefix system, shedding
light on its evolution and the five distinct prefixes delineated within the
`conda` source code.

In the nascent stages of `conda`'s development, its primary functionality
revolved around installing packages into a singular environment, at the time
referred to as the `root` environment. This era, marked by `conda` versions
preceding 4.2.0, laid the groundwork for `conda`'s subsequent evolution as an
environment manager.

With the advent of [`conda 4.2.0`][conda-4.2.0] and beyond, a paradigm shift
occurred when the `conda-env` project was [merged][conda-env-pr] with the
`conda` project, elevating `conda` from a mere package manager to a
comprehensive environment manager. This pivotal transformation bestowed upon
`conda` the capability to create and manage separate environments, fostering
modularity and flexibility in development workflows.

Delving into `conda`'s Git history via `git blame` provides invaluable insights
into the timeline of the prefix system evolution. By tracing the commit history,
we unearthed pivotal moments that introduced and refined the various prefixes
integral to `conda`'s architecture. The history reveals two distinct phases in
the evolution of `conda`'s prefix system. The first phase occurred early on in
`conda 1.x` and the second phase much later in `conda 4.x` with the merging of
`conda-env` with `conda`.

Here are the five prefixes defined within conda, ordered from the lowest level (system-level
and least configurable) to the highest level (user-level and most configurable):

### `conda.base.context.context.conda_prefix`

Introduced in `conda 4.2.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/6e730cc)
as part of the private environment effort, which has since been abandoned and
deprecated.

The `conda_prefix` lies at the heart of the prefix system, denoting the
installation directory of `conda` itself. Typically, this aligns with the
location of the `base` environment and is equivalent to Python's `sys.prefix`
value.

:::info

Use this any time you need to interact with the `conda` installation itself.

:::

### `conda.base.context.context.root_prefix`

:::note[Previously]

&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.config.ROOT_DIR`\
&nbsp;↓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.config.root_dir`\
&nbsp;○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.base.context.context.root_prefix`

:::

Introduced in `conda 1.1.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/d2b370a)
and was originally intended for testing purposes only.

The `root_prefix` serves as a [configurable value][condarc], most easily
configurable in the user's `~/.condarc` file. In the absence of user-defined
preferences, it defaults to the `conda_prefix`.

:::warning

Avoid using this. This is a contender for deprecation.

:::

### `conda.base.context.context.active_prefix`

Introduced in `conda 4.4.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/cbbe81f)
as part of cleaning up the `conda info` output.

Reflecting the currently active environment, the `active_prefix` is determined
by the `$CONDA_PREFIX` environment variable, which is set by the `conda activate`
and `conda deactivate` commands.

:::warning

Avoid using this. Treat this as an internal value.

:::

### `conda.base.context.context.default_prefix`

:::note[Previously]

&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.anaconda.default_environment`\
&nbsp;↓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.config.default_environment`\
&nbsp;↓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.config.DEFAULT_ENV_PREFIX`\
&nbsp;↓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.config.default_prefix`\
&nbsp;○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.base.context.context.default_prefix`

:::

Introduced in `conda 1.1.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/acd8144)
as part of a larger configuration overhaul.

The `default_prefix` is the same as `active_prefix` when an environment is
active. When no environment is active the default environment is returned
(which can be overridden via the `$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` environment variable)
and otherwise defaults to the `root_prefix`.

:::warning

Avoid using this. Treat this as an internal value.

:::

### `conda.base.context.context.target_prefix`

:::note[Previously]

&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.cli.utils.get_prefix()`\
&nbsp;↓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.cli.common.get_prefix()`\
&nbsp;↓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.base.context.context.prefix`\
&nbsp;○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`conda.base.context.context.target_prefix`

:::

Introduced in `conda 1.3.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/9fd0f4b)
to abstract out the `--name`/`--prefix` logic from the CLI implementations.

The `target_prefix` is the highest level prefix and reflects the user input
via the CLI options, `--name` or `--prefix`. In the absence of CLI overrides,
it defaults to the `default_prefix`.

:::info

Use this when you need to interact with the current environment.

:::

In essence, the `conda` prefix system serves as the cornerstone of its environment
management capabilities, facilitating seamless navigation and interaction within
the different environments a user may have created. As `conda` continues to
evolve, understanding its prefix system remains paramount for harnessing its
capabilities effectively and correctly.
