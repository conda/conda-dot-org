Starting in 2026, the community calls for conda and conda-forge have merged in a single timeslot. Instead of alternating weeks, from now on, both communities will share the same space every Wednesday. There are two rotating timeslots:

- 2PM UTC
- 5PM UTC

The first meeting in 2026 will take place on January 7th, at 5PM UTC. For more details consult the [calendar](/community/calendar/).

The meeting minutes will be available in both conda.org and conda-forge.org, in the usual places.

This is one of our first steps towards reducing the administrative duplication existing between these overlapping communities.
