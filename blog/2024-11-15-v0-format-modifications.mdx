  old format (`meta.yaml`, v0). The conda community must balance innovation with support for

The recent approval of a new recipe format (v1) by the Conda Steering Council
via [CEP-13][cep-13] and [CEP-14][cep-14] marks an important milestone in the
evolution of package management in the conda ecosystem. While the community
embraces the potential improvements that come with the new format, we
acknowledge that the v1 recipe format is still undergoing development
in [rattler-build][rattler-build]. Consequently, the v0 recipe
format remains widely in use, emphasizing the need to balance innovation with support
for legacy systems.

While the focus is on innovating with the v1 format, the transition and adoption
will take time. In the meantime, we still need to remain responsive to the challenges
and requirements of those who continue to rely on the v0 format for their packaging
needs. Updates to the v0 format should be driven by the needs of the user
community, guided by user feedback, and aimed at addressing pain points.

To initiate changes to the v0 conda-build recipe format, the following workflow
is followed:

1. **Conda Enhancement Proposal**: Any proposed modifications to the v0 format should
   also be proposed in the v1 format. The rationale being, if it's necessary for v0
   it should also be necessary for v1. All proposals go through the CEP process;
   see [CEPs][ceps].
2. **Review & Approval**: The proposed modification will undergo the CEP review and
   approval process and results in a v1 recipe format `schema_version` bump.
3. **Implementation**: Once approved, the changes can be implemented in the v0
   format, ensuring alignment with the corresponding features in the v1 format.

As the community navigates the transition from v0 to v1, we aim to offer clear
communication and guidance. Developers and maintainers need to be equipped with the
resources and support necessary to understand the implications of the new format
and make informed decisions about when and how to migrate (see
[rattler-build's recipe docs][rattler-recipe],
[rattler-build's migration docs][rattler-migration], and [conda-recipe-manager docs][crm]).

The approval of the v1 format represents an exciting step forward for the conda
ecosystem. However, it's essential to recognize that change takes time, and the
transition to the new format will be gradual. In the interim, the v0 format
remains a critical component of the conda ecosystem and requires ongoing
support and updates. As always the goal is to offer a smooth transition to the new
standards while continuing to support the existing infrastructure and user base.
