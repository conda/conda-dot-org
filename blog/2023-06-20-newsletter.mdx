**Welcome to the first ever conda community newsletter!** The newsletter will highlight recent and upcoming activity that is relevant to the [conda community](https://conda.org/). This first issue highlights releases, grants, events, ....

We are hoping these will become a semi-regular feature in the conda landscape going forward. If you have an item to include in a future newsletter, please let us know by posting it to the [Conda Communications Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/%23conda-communications:matrix.org) or by creating an issue in the [Conda Communications GitHub Repo](https://github.com/conda/communications/issues).

<!-- truncate -->

Finally, if you want to receive these newsletters from the comfort of your inbox, **please sign up for the [Conda Announce Mailing list](https://lists.conda.org/wws/info/announce).**

Happy reading,<br />
The Editors


## Community Gathering Spaces

---

**This section will be replaced with a link to Pinak's writeup.**

---

<!--
The past year has seen the launch of a cohort of places for the conda community to gather online. Please join us:

* **[conda.org](https://conda.org)**: The conda community now has its own [web site](https://conda.org).
* **[Q&A Forum](https://conda.discourse.group/)**: Q & about the entire ecosystem.
* **[Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#conda:matrix.org)**: Chat rooms about [everything](a), [conda-forge](a), [bioconda](a) [Constructor](a) and [Installer](a), [conda-build](a), [mamaba](a), [libmamba](a), ([Governance](a), [Communication](a)) and more.
* **[Conda Announce Mailing List](https://lists.conda.org/wws/info/announce)**: Get monthly (or fewer) notifications about important conda stuff in your inbox (like this newsletter).
-->

### Community calls

Please join us every other week to learn what is going on in the conda community and to provide your input.

* The Mamba project has [bi-weekly community calls](https://hackmd.io/iOgkxNMpTea6lWczjCov9Q?view) on Tuesdays. Our next call is June 27.
* The overall conda community has [bi-weekly calls](https://hackmd.io/@conda-community?tags=%5B%22meeting-notes%22%5D) on Wednesdays. The next one is on June 21.


## Upcoming events

### SciPy 2023 Conda & Friends Sprint, July 15-16, Austin

<Image img={scipybanner} alt="Banner image for SciPy2023"/>

The [conda community will again be meeting] **(LINK TO MATRIX CHANNEL?)** at the [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/) meeting in Austin, Texas for two days of collaborative work.

[Sprints](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/sprints) are open to everyone who is interested in contributing to the various projects in the conda ecosystem (e.g. projects under the [conda](https://github.com/conda), [conda-incubator](https://github.com/conda-incubator), [mamba-org](https://github.com/mamba-org), [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge), ... GitHub organizations), what we call "conda and friends".

First and foremost, **the goal of conda community sprints is to grow the conda contributor community**. We mean "contributor" in the broadest possible sense: not just code, but also documentation, bug reports, forum questions (and answers), community events, new tools and plugs, and of course, new pull requests for existing tools too.

### PackagingCon 2023, October 26-28, Berlin

<Image img={packagingcon} alt="Banner image for PackagingCon 2023"/>

[**PackagingCon 2023**](https://packaging-con.org/) brings together the software packaging community to present and discuss common challenges and unique solutions to software packaging. The conference is open to all packaging communities, including language-specific, OS-specific, and broader solutions such as conda.

**[Abstract submission](https://cfp.packaging-con.org/2023/cfp) and [early registration](https://ti.to/packagingcon/packagingcon-2023) are now open for PackagingCon**.

PackagingCon 2023 will be held October 26-28 in Berlin, and will be a hybrid event. The call for submissions closes July 31. Early registration ends September 8, *but (in-person) space is limited and you are encouraged to register early.*

## Rattler!

<Image img={rattler} alt="Banner image for Rattler, from GitHub project"/>

* [rattler](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler) is a new collection of Rust libraries to work with conda packages made by the prefix.dev team!
  * rattler 0.3.0 just came out with lots of highlights, such as JLAP support, local `file://` urls and authenticated requests with the new `rattler_networking`. For the full (impressive) changelog, see here: https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/releases/tag/v0.3.0

* [rattler-build](https://prefix.dev/blog/the_new_rattler_build) is built on top rattler to facilitate the creation of conda packages. It already _works_ very well and is much faster than conda-build. To push this effort forward, we started multiple conda enhancement proposals. Engage with us and the conda community on a forward-looking YAML format that is easy to parse (pure YAML) and keeps most of the conda-build functionalities!
  * A new YAML format: https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/54
  * Integration with VSCode for the [new YAML format with automatic syntax linting](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/56#issuecomment-1593118521)
  * A new way to define multiple outputs and tests: https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/56
  * A new test for file existence inside of packages: https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/57

### Conda, now starring on YouTube

**Conda now has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNc3BL-gO8hbx_7DdEDcofg)** with four playlists/videos to start you off: **[Packaging](https://youtu.be/6by8b2Ht200), [Presentations](https://youtu.be/OeSv0_HesaU), [Training](https://youtu.be/NSgTFf40vHQ)**, and **[Releases](https://youtu.be/VD5TXcbYgR4)**.

### Highlights from the Conda Community Forum

The [Conda Community Forum](https://conda.discourse.group/) is an online Q&A site for questions and discussions about the conda ecosystem. Here is a sampling of recent posts, including some that still need responses:

* [How to install a “bash completion script” for my conda-forge package?](https://conda.discourse.group/t/how-to-install-a-bash-completion-script-for-my-conda-forge-package/304)
* [My miniconda3 installation is screwed up. Reinstall? something else?](https://conda.discourse.group/t/my-miniconda3-installation-is-screwed-up-reinstall-something-else/310)
* [Miniconda - Channel conda-forge not working - Traceback message](https://conda.discourse.group/t/miniconda-channel-conda-forge-not-working-traceback-message/297)
* [Install Miniconda for MacOS - Difference between bash and pkg](https://conda.discourse.group/t/install-miniconda-for-macos-difference-between-bash-and-pkg/292) (unanswered)

And this thought provoking post from Ralk Gommers in February
