### Is conda Free?

[**In Dave Clement's latest blog post**](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/is-conda-free#summarize), he clarifies the question that's on everyone's mind: "_Is conda truly free?_" Here's a brief overview:

- Conda, the package and environment management software, is open source and free for anyone to use.

- Conda-compatible packages from conda-forge, Bioconda, and other public channels are also free for all users.

- For packages in the default channel and Anaconda Distribution:

  - Organizations with fewer than 200 people can use them for free.
  - Larger organizations can still qualify for free use if they meet Anaconda's terms of service exemptions, including developers, students, teachers, academic institutions, non-commercial open source software projects, and small businesses.

For an in-depth look at conda's free offerings and the finer details, dive into [**Dave Clement's full blog post here**](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/is-conda-free#summarize).

### New pre and post command plugin hooks

Discover the latest in conda extensibility with the introduction of **"pre command" and "post command" plugin hooks**. These powerful additions, available since conda release 23.7.2, allow plugin authors to execute code before and after conda commands, expanding the possibilities for customizing your conda experience.

[**Key highlights from Travis Hathaway's blog post:**](https://conda.org/blog/2023-07-31-latest-conda-release-includes-new-plugin-hooks/)

**Pre Command Hook**: This hook enables you to execute code before specified conda commands run. It's a game-changer for customizing and extending conda's default behavior. An excellent example of its practical application can be found in the conda-protect project, where it's used to safeguard conda environments.

**Post Command Hook**: Similar to the pre command hook, the post command hook lets you run code after conda commands have successfully executed. This opens up exciting opportunities, like creating a simple command counter to analyze your conda usage.

For detailed implementation examples and insights into these new plugin hooks, [dive into Travis Hathaway's blog post here](https://conda.org/blog/2023-07-31-latest-conda-release-includes-new-plugin-hooks/).

### Pandata

**Pandata** is a collaborative effort of various Python libraries. These libraries are carefully crafted to seamlessly complement each other, ensuring scalability, interactivity, and more.

In essence, Pandata serves as your guide to a suite of libraries designed to work harmoniously. By using any of these libraries, you can rest assured that they're tailored to fit together seamlessly, preserving scalability and interactivity.
