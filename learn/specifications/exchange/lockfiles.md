# Lockfiles

:::note[Work in Progress]
This part of the ecosystem is not standardized yet.

Some preliminary information can be found at:
- https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/output/
- https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/pixi-migration/
- https://docs.rs/rattler_lock/latest/rattler_lock/
- https://pixi.sh/v0.55.0/first_project/#lockfile

[Text spec files](text-spec.md) can be used as a minimal lockfile too.
