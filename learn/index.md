# What is conda

We are a community supporting a language-agnostic, multi-platform packaging ecosystem for projects of any size and complexity. This section of our website is devoted to helping those new to community learn how everything works.

If you are brand new to conda, we recommend starting with our extensive [FAQ](./faq.md) page.

For a detailed list of conda enhancement proposals (CEP), see [CEPs](./ceps.mdx).

To learn more about interoperability standards, see [Specifications](./specifications.md).
