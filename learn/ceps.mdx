# Conda Enhancement Proposals (CEPs)

Conda is an Open Source project with a diverse and wide-ranging ecosystem.

To better allow community members to provide feedback and proposals for conda's implementation,
all major changes should be submitted as a **Conda Enhancement Proposal** (CEP).

The list below is automatically populated from the [`conda/ceps`](https://github.com/conda/ceps) repository.
